int         varint = inputStream.getVarInt();
std::string str    = inputStream.getString();
// ... 


// Write
BinaryStream outputStream;
outputStream.writeFloat(3.1415f);
outputStream.writeUnsignedVarInt64(1234567890);
outputStream.writeSignedShort(16384);
//...

std::string outputBuffer = outputStream.getAndReleaseData();
std::string outputBuffer = outputStream.getAndReleaseData();
```
