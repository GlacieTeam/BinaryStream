**Part of [Bedrock Procotol Library](https://github.com/GlacieTeam/ProtocolLib).**  
A BinaryStream Library written in C++

## Usage
```C++
using namespace bedrock_protocol;

// Read
std::string inputBuffer; // Buffer to read

ReadOnlyBinaryStream inputStream(inputBuffer);
uint8_t     byte   = inputStream.getByte();
int         varint = inputStream.getVarInt();
std::string str    = inputStream.getString();
// ... 


// Write
BinaryStream outputStream;
outputStream.writeFloat(3.1415f);
outputStream.writeUnsignedVarInt64(1234567890);
outputStream.writeSignedShort(16384);
//...

std::string outputBuffer = outputStream.getAndReleaseData();
std::string outputBuffer = outputStream.getAndReleaseData();
```
